go-ble is likely a Go (Golang) library or project focused on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionality.

**Note:** 🌱 This is a spare-time hobby project, so progress may be slow and changes may appear irregular. Thank you for your patience 🙂

This project is based on [tinygo.org/x/bluetooth](https://tinygo.org/x/bluetooth), a well-known Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) library for Go. The goal of go-ble is to provide a simpler and more user-friendly interface for BLE development in Go, making it easier for developers to build BLE applications without deep knowledge of the underlying Bluetooth stack.
